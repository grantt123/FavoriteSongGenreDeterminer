# Favorite-Song-Genre-Determiner
This program's purpose is that it analyzes a certain amount of song genres and determines your favorite song genre after a course of a week via user input. 
The users of the software is the user itself.
This program will be used whenever the user wants to during the day, but needs to use it once a day for a week. They can use it anywhere as long as they have this program.
This software works by the user inputting their favorite song for the day into the system and the system saves it to keep up for the entire week. Once the week is finished, it will show the user's most listened to song genre.
People may want to use this for their own use. They may wonder what type of music they like to listen to and what their most listened to genre is.
